This file contains 100 songs (#1 - #100).
You can find more abc tune files at http://www.norbeck.nu/abc/
I've transcribed them as I remember them, which does not necessarily mean
that the lyrics are exactly as in the "original". This is part of the "folk process"
of transmitting songs.
The melody is often just an approximation (especially for the slow songs), and
does not include ornamentation, just the "bare bones". Also the key chosen
is one that fits my voice - transpose it to fit your voice.
The songs were learnt from sessions, from friends or from recordings.

W:My love is one of the fairest young men
W:that ever was in this country
W:But how to win him I do not know it,
W:for he is sentenced for to die.
W:
W:As he walked up the streets of Derry,
W:he walked so proud and so manfully
W:He was far more like a commanding officer
W:Than a man to die upon the gallows tree.
W:
W:The first time he went to climb the ladder,
W:His bloomin' face began to pale
W:and this he said, "Is there no assistance",
W:"Is there no release in the Derry Gaol?
W:
W:He took one other step up the ladder,
W:His beloved father was standing by,
W:"Come here, come here, my beloved father,
W:and speak one word to me before I die."
W:
W:The next time he went to climb the ladder,
W:His beloved sister was standing by,
W:"Come here, come here, my beloved sister,
W:and speak one word to me before I die."
W:
W:"I wonder what became of my true love
W:and what has sent her so far from me
W:Or does she think it a great dishonour
W:For to see me die upon the gallows tree?"
W:
W:He looked around, and he saw her coming
W:And she was dressed up in woollen so fine
W:and every step as she drew nearer
W:was swifter than the blowing wind. (wined)
W:
W:Come down, come down, off that weary gallows,
W:For I've got your pardon now from the king
W:and I'll show you, we will be united
W:And I'll crown my Johnny with a laurel wreath.

W:Farewell to the groves of shillelagh and shamrock,
W:Farewell to the wee girls of Ireland all round.
W:May their hearts be as merry as ever I would wish for
W:When it's far across the Atlantic I'm bound.
W:
W:My father is old and my mother quite feeble,
W:And to leave their own country it grieves their hearts sore.
W:Oh, the tears down their cheeks in great drops are rolling
W:To think they must die upon a foreign shore.
W:
W:But what matters to me where my bones may be buried
W:If in peace and contentment I can spend my life.
W:Oh, the green fields of Canada they daily are blooming,
W:'Tis there I'll put an end to my misery and strife.
W:
W:So it's pack up your sea stores, consider no longer,
W:For ten dollars a week isn't very bad pay,
W:With no taxes or tithes to devour up your wages
W:When you're on the green fields of Americay.
W:
W:The sheep run unsheared and the land's gone to rushes,
W:The handyman's gone and the winder of creels.
W:Away across the ocean go journeyman tailors
W:And fiddlers who flaked out the old mountain reels.
W:
W:But I mind the time when old Ireland was flourishing,
W:When lots of our tradesmen did work for good pay.
W:But since out manufacturies have crossed the Atlantic,
W:Sure, there we must follow to Americay.
W:
W:So it's pack up your sea stores and consider no longer,
W:For ten dollars a week isn't very bad pay,
W:With no taxes or tithes to devour up your wages
W:When you're on the green fields of Americay.
W:
W:And it's now to conclude and to finish my story,
W:If ever friendless Irishmen chances my way,
W:With the best in the house I will greet him and welcome
W:At home on the green fields of Americay.
W:
W:So it's pack up your sea stores and consider no longer,

W:On the first of November, on a bright autumn day
W:To the hills of Dromeen I chanced for to stray
W:I was feeding on green grass, that grows on yon ground
W:When my heart was set a-beating by the crying of the hounds

W:Mush-a rang tally-ho, hark ye over hi-dee ho
W:Hark ye over cries the huntsman, hark ye over hi ho
W:
W:They hunted me up, and they hunted me down
W:The bold huntsmen of Stiahan, on my trail sent the hounds
W:Over highlands and lowlands, moorlands also,
W:Over hedges and ditches, like the wind I did go.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:There was ringwood and roses, they gave me a close brush
W:It was then they found me hiding, it was in a rush bush
W:For better or worse, I know I must die,
W:But I do my endeavour, these hounds to defy
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:Then up stands the huntsman, to end all my strife
W:Sayin' lay the hare down, give her plea for her life
W:Wouldnt it be for better, you killed rather the fox
W:Who ate all your chickens, fat hen and gay cock?
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:And now I must die, and I know not the crime
W:For the value of sixpence, I ne'er harmed mankind
W:I ne'er was brought up for to rob or to steal
W:Except for the crabbin' some tops of green kale

W:Where Lagan streams sing lullabies
W:There grows a lily fair
W:The twilight is in her eye
W:The night is on her hair
W:And like a lovesick lennashee
W:She has my heart in thrall
W:No life have I nor liberty
W:For love is lord of all.
W:
W:Her father sails a running-barge
W:'Twixt Leamh-beag and The Druim,
W:And on the lonely river-marge
W:She clears his hearth for him.
W:When she was only fairy-high
W:Her gentle mother died,
W:But dew-love keeps her memory
W:Green on the Lagan side.
W:
W:And often when the beetle's horn
W:Has lulled this eve to sleep
W:I'll steal into her shieling lorn
W:And through the doorway creep.
W:There on the cricket's singing stone,
W:She makes the bogwood fire,
W:And hums in soft sweet undertone
W:The songs of heart's desire
W:
W:Her welcome, like her love for me,
W:Is from her heart within:
W:Her warm kiss is felicity
W:That knows no taint of sin.
W:And, when I stir my foot to go,
W:'Tis leaving love and light
W:To feel the wind of longing blow
W:From out the dark of night.

W:One morning as I went a-fowling

W:These beautiful notes she did sing.

W:Her cheeks were as red as the roses
W:That bloom around Lough Erne's shore.

W:When I found that my love was eloping
W:These words unto her I did say:
W:"Oh, take me to your habitation
W:For Cupid has led me astray."
W:"Forever I'll keep the commandments.
W:They say that it is the best plan.
W:Fair maids who do yield to men's pleasures
W:The scripture does say they are wrong."
W:
W:"Oh, Mary don't accuse me of weakness,
W:For treachery I do disown.
W:I will make you a lady of honour
W:If with me this night you'll come home.
W:Oh, had I the lamp of great Aladdin,
W:His rings and his genie what's more.
W:I would part with them all for to gain you
W:And live upon Lough Erne's shore."

W:In the neat little town they call Belfast
W:apprenticed to trade I was bound,
W:and many's the hour of sweet happiness
W:have I spent in that neat little town.

W:'Til a sad misfortune came over me,

W:Not intending to stay very long,
W:When who should I meet but this pretty fair maid
W:as she came a-prancing along.

W:and a gentleman passing us by,
W:I knew she meant the doing of him

W:A gold watch she took from his pocket
W:And placed it right into my hand
W:And the very next thing that I said was

W:On the fourth of July eighteen hundred and six
W:We set sail from the sweet Cobh of Cork
W:We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
W:For the grand city hall in New York
W:'Twas a wonderful craft
W:She was rigged fore and aft
W:And oh, how the wild wind drove her
W:She stood several blasts
W:She had twenty seven masts
W:And they called her The Irish Rover
W:
W:We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
W:We had two million barrels of stone
W:We had three million sides of old blind horses hides
W:We had four million barrels of bone
W:We had five million hogs
W:and six million dogs
W:Seven million barrels of porter
W:We had eight million bales of old nanny goats tails
W:In the hold of the Irish Rover
W:
W:There was Barney McGee
W:From the banks of the Lee
W:There was Hogan from County Tyrone
W:There was Johnny McGurk
W:Who was scared stiff of work
W:And a man from Westmeath called Malone
W:There was Slugger O'Toole
W:Who was drunk as a rule
W:And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
W:And your man, Mick McCann
W:From the banks of the Bann
W:Was the skipper of the Irish Rover
W:

W:Who played hard on his flute
W:When the ladies lined up for the set
W:He was tootin' with skill
W:For each sparkling quadrille
W:'Til the dancers were fluthered and bet

W:It's so lonesome by night and by day

W:Near Banbridge Town, in the County Down
W:one morning last July,
W:from a boreen green came a sweet colleen,
W:and she smiled as she passed me by.
W:She looked so neat from her two bare feet
W:to the sheen of her nut-brown hair,
W:Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself
W:for to see I was really there.
W:
W:Chorus:
W:From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay,
W:and from Galway to Dublin town,
W:no maid I've seen like the brown colleen
W:that I met in the County Down.
W:
W:As she onward sped sure I shook my head
W:and I looked with a feeling rare,
W:and I said, says I, to a passer-by,
W:"Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?"
W:He smiled at me, and he said, says he,
W:"That's the gem of Ireland's crown,
W:young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann,
W:she's the Star of the County Down."
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:She'd a soft brown eye and a look so sly
W:and a smile like the rose in June
W:And you hung on each note from her lily-white throat,
W:as she lilted an Irish tune.
W:At the pattern dance you were held in trance
W:as she skipped through a jig or reel
W:When her eyes she'd roll, she would lift your soul
W:And your heart she would likely steal
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:I've travelled a bit, but I ne'er was hit
W:since my roving career began.
W:But fair and square I surrendered there
W:To the charms of young Rose McCann.
W:I'd a heart to let and no tenant yet
W:Did I meet with in shawl or gown,
W:But in she went and I asked no rent
W:From the Star of the County Down.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:At the harvest fair she'll be surely there
W:and I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
W:with my hat cocked right, and my shoes shone bright,
W:for a smile from my nut-brown Rose.
W:No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
W:till my plow it is rust coloured brown,
W:till my smiling bride by my own fireside
W:sits the Star of the County Down.

W:The silvery moon was shining bright over Clara's woodland green.
W:A tender youth was standing where his own true love had been.
W:The teardrops from her throbbing eyes across his cheeks streamed o'er,
W:for they met at night to say goodbye by the banks of Avonmore.
W:
W:'Twas not the rustling of the leaves on the branches wild and weird,
W:'twas not the sighing western wind that crept through Clara dale,
W:that made her tender heart mourn for the boy she did adore,
W:for she knew right well he'd ne'er return to the banks of Avonmore.
W:
W:Well he clasped her close unto his breast and he murmured sweet and true:
W:Tonight my ship sails for the West but my love I leave with you,
W:and I will pray both night and day, though on a foreign shore,
W:for to keep your love far, far away, on the banks of Avonmore.

W:mid crushing steel and thundering guns their allied ranks gave way
W:from the USA a proud convoy sped quickly to the fore
W:and in their ranks a Wicklow boy from the banks of Avonmore.

W:They tried to quell the wild advance of the exile sons of Erin.
W:Victorious true but deadly few the stars and stripes shone over,
W:but her true love fell far, far away from the banks of Avonmore.
W:
W:Now a few short years have come and gone, and again the moon shines clear,
W:No more this fair maid walks alone to shed a silent tear,
W:but faithful to her soldier boy they've met to part no more
W:in a brighter land far, far from the banks of Avonmore.

W:Well it's by the hush me boys, and sure that's to hold your noise
W:and listen to poor Paddy's sad narration.
W:I was by hunger pressed, and in poverty distressed,
W:So I took a thought I'd leave the Irish nation.
W:
W:Chorus:
W:Here's you boys, now take my advice
W:to Americay I'll have yous not be coming
W:there is nothing here but war, where the murdering cannons roar,
W:and I wish I was at home in dear old Dublin.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:Well, I sold me horse and cow, my little pigs and sow
W:My little plot of land I soon did part with
W:And me sweetheart Bid McGee I'm afraid I'll never see
W:For I left her there that morning broken hearted.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:Well, meself and a hundred more, to Americay sailed o'er
W:Our fortunes to be made we were thinkin'
W:When we got to Yankee land, they shoved a gun into our hands
W:Sayin': "Paddy, you must go and fight for Lincoln."
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:General Meagher to us he said, if you get shot or lose your leg
W:Every single one of yous will get a pension.
W:Well, myself I lost me leg, they gave me a wooden peg
W:And by God this is the truth to you I mention.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:Now I think myself in luck if I get fed on Indian buck,
W:and old Ireland, is the country I delight in.
W:And the Devil I do say, it's curse Americay,
W:For I think I've had enough of your hard fightin'.

W:that sits in the corner smellin' a rat.
W:Boys, wheest your philanderin' now and behave,
W:and savin' your favours I'll chant you a stave.
W:I come from a land where the praties grow big,

W:as he faced up his partner and turned up his brogue.
W:He twisted the buckle and bent at the knee,
W:oh, they're wonderful dancers in Tanderagee.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:Now, show me the man either Christian or Turk,
W:who could equal our brave Robbert Emmett or Burke,
W:and show me the speaker could speak up like Dan,
W:ach, divil another bad luck to the one,
W:Oh show me the singer could sing like Tom Moore,
W:his melodies charmed all care from our door,
W:But we'll beat them all yet, and that you will see,
W:for we're rare and fine boys around Tanderagee.
W:

W:His old jauntin' car was the elegant joult,
W:and Derry's the place that is famed for her hoult,

W:And at the time of writing I am not a pretty sight
W:Me body is all black and blue, me face a deathly gray
W:And I write this note to say why Paddy's not at work today
W:
W:While working on the fourteenth floor some bricks I had to clear
W:Now to throw the bricks from such a height was not a good idea
W:The foreman wasn't very pleased, he being an awkward sod
W:He said I'd have to cart them down the ladders in me hod
W:
W:Now clearing all these bricks by hand it was so very slow
W:So I hoisted up a barrel and secured the rope below
W:But in me haste to do the job I was too blind to see
W:That a barrel full of building bricks was heavier than me
W:
W:So when I untied the rope the barrel fell like lead
W:And clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead
W:I shot up like a rocket 'til to my dismay I found
W:That halfway up I met the bloody barrel coming down
W:
W:Well, the barrel broke me shoulder as to the ground it sped
W:And when I reached the top I banged the pulley with me head
W:I clung on tight though numb with shock from this almighty blow
W:And the barrel spilled out half the bricks fourteen floors below
W:
W:Now, when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor
W:I then outweighed the barrel and so started down once more
W:Still clinging tightly to the rope I sped towards the ground
W:And I landed on the broken bricks that were all scattered round
W:
W:Well, I lay there groaning on the ground I thought I'd passed the worst
W:When the barrel hit the pulley wheel and then the bottom burst
W:A shower of bricks rained down on me, I hadn't got a hope
W:As I lay there moaning on the ground, I let go the bloody rope
W:
W:The barrel then being heavier it started down once more
W:And landed right across me as I lay upon the floor
W:It broke three ribs and my left arm and I can only say
W:That I hope you'll understand why Paddy's not at work today

W:And around the country I will go to see my journeyman!"

W:I am a rovin' journeyman, I go from town to town,
W:Whenever I get a job of work I'm willing to sit down
W:Me kit's all on me shoulder and me graftin' tool in hand
W:And around the country I will go a rovin' journeyman.

W:Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken-hearted
W:Saluted Father dear, kissed my darlin' Mother
W:Drank a pint of beer my grief and tears to smother
W:Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
W:I cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins,
W:A brand new pair of brogues, rattling o'er the bogs
W:And frightening all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin,

W:Started by daylight next morning light and airy,
W:Took a drop of the pure, to keep my heart from sinkin',

W:To see the lasses smile, laughing all the while,
W:At my curious style, would set your heart a-bubbling,

W:Till I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.

W:To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city,

W:Something crossed my mind, when I looked behind,
W:No bundle could I find upon me stick a-wobblin',
W:Enquiring for the rogue, they said my Connaught brogue
W:Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.
W:

W:
W:From there I got away my spirits never failing,
W:Landed on the quay as the ship was sailing,
W:Captain at me roared, said that no room had he,
W:When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy
W:Down among the pigs, I played some funny jigs
W:Danced among the rigs, the water round me bubblin'
W:When off Holyhead I wished myself was dead,
W:Or better far, instead, on the rocky road to Dublin.
W:

W:
W:The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
W:Called myself a fool, I could no longer stand it,
W:Blood began to boil, temper I was losin'
W:Poor old Erin's isle they began abusin'
W:"Hurrah my soul!" says I, shillelagh I let fly,
W:Some Galway boys were by, saw I was a hobblin',
W:Then with a loud hurray, they joined in the affray,
W:We quickly cleared the way, for the rocky road to Dublin.

W:
W:I see by your gravestone your were only nineteen

W:Well I hope you died quick and I hope you died clean
W:Or Willy McBride was it slow and obscene?

W:Did they beat the drum slowly? Did they sound the fifes lowly?
W:Did the rifles fire o'er you as they lowered you down?
W:Did the band play The Last Post in chorus?
W:Did the pipes play The Flowers of the Forest?
W:
W:Did you have a wife or a sweetheart, McBride?
W:In some loyal heart is your memory enshrined,
W:And although you died back in nineteen sixteen,
W:In that loyal heart are you always nineteen?

W:Or are you just a stranger not even a name,
W:Forever to sit behind some glass frame,
W:In an old photograph torn and tattered and stained
W:And fading to yellow in a brown leather frame.

W:And the a warm summer wind makes the red poppies dance,

W:
W:But here in this graveyard it's still no man's land,
W:And countless white crosses in mute witness stand,
W:To man's blind indifference to his fellow man,
W:And a whole generation who were butchered and damned.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:Well I can't help but wonder now, Willy McBride,
W:Do all those that lie here know why did they died?
W:Did you really believe them when they told you the cause?
W:Did you really believe that this war would end wars?
W:
W:But the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain,
W:The killing, the dying was all done in vain,
W:For Willy McBride it's all happening again,
W:And again, and again, and again, and again.

W:And the world did gaze in deep amaze, at those fearless men, but few
W:Who bore the fight that freedom's light might shine through the foggy dew

W:For I parted then with valiant men whom I never shall see more

W:If you gather all around me a story I will tell,

W:'Tis twelve months come October since I left my native home,

W:And now I wear a Guernsey and around my waist a belt,
W:I'm the gaffer of the squad that lays the hot asphalt.

W:Won't you kindly let me light me pipe down by your boiler fire?"
W:He stands there right in front of me with coat-tails up so neat,
W:"Ah", says I: "My decent man! You'd better go and mind your beat."
W:"Ah, well" says he: "I'm down on you! I'm up to all your pranks!

W:That he landed in the boiler full of hot asphalt.

W:And with soap and boiling water we began to rub and scrub.
W:But devil a bit of tar came off and it turned as hard as stone,
W:And with every rub we gave him you could hear that copper groan.
W:With the rubbing and the scrubbing sure he caught his death of cold,
W:And for scientific purposes his body it was sold.
W:In the Kelvingrove Museum now he's hanging by the belt,
W:As a monument to the Irish laying hot asphalt.

W:A-seeking good fortune and what might betide

W:We met Seargeant Harper and Corporal Cramp
W:Besides the wee drummer who beat up our camp
W:With his rowdy-dow-dow in the morning.
W:
W:He says: "My young fellows if you will enlist
W:a guinea you quickly will have in your fist
W:and likewise a crown for to kick up the dust
W:and drink the king's health in the morning
W:For a soldier he leads a very fine life

W:And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife
W:And always lives pleasant and charming."
W:
W:"A soldier he always is decent and clean,
W:In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen,
W:While other poor fellows go dirty and mean
W:And sup on thin gruel in the morning."
W:Says Arthur: "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes,
W:for you've only the lend of them as I suppose,
W:and you dare not change them one night, for you know,
W:if you do you'll be flogged in the morning."
W:
W:"Although we are single and free
W:we take great delight in our own company,
W:and we have no desire strange countries to see,
W:although that your offer is charming.
W:But had we been such fools as to take the advance
W:The wee bit of money we'd have to run chance
W:For you'd think it no scruples for to send us to France
W:Where we would be killed in the morning."
W:
W:He says: "My young fellows if I hear but one word
W:I instantly now will out with my sword
W:and into your bodies as strength might afford
W:so now my gay devils take warning."
W:But Arthur and I we soon took the odds
W:And we gave them no chance for to launch out their swords
W:Our whacking shillelaghs came over their heads
W:And paid them right smart in the morning.
W:
W:As for the wee drummer we rifled his pouch
W:and we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow
W:and into the ocean for to rock and to roll
W:And bade it a tedious returning
W:As for the old rapier that hung by his side
W:We flung as far as we could in the tide
W:To the divil I pitch you says Arthur McBride
W:To temper your steel in the morning.

W:It's of a gentleman soldier, as sentry he did stand
W:He saluted a fair maid by a waving of his hand
W:So boldly then he kissed her, and he passed it off as a joke
W:He drilled her up in the sentry box wrapped up in a soldier's cloak
W:

W:And the drums they go a rat-a-ta-tat, and the fifes they loudly play
W:"Fare thee well, Polly my dear, I must be going away"

W:All night they tossed and tumbled, till daylight did appear
W:The soldier rose, put on his clothes, saying, "Fare ye well my dear

W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:Now come you gentleman soldier, won't you marry me?
W:Oh no, my dearest Polly, such things can never be
W:For I've a wife already, and children I have three
W:Two wives are allowed in the army, but one's too many for me

W:If anyone comes a-courting you, you can treat them to a glass

W:That you were drilled in a sentry box wrapped up in a soldier's cloak

W:Oh come ye gentleman soldier, why didn't you tell me so?

W:She had a little militia boy and she didn't know his name

W:'Twas on one bright March morning I bid New Orleans adieu
W:And I took the road to Jackson town, my fortune to renew
W:I cursed all foreign money, no credit could I gain

W:
W:I stepped on board a railroad car beneath the morning sun
W:And I rode the roads till evening and I laid me down again
W:All strangers there, no friends to me till a dark girl towards me came
W:And I fell in love with a Creole girl by the Lakes of Pontchartrain.
W:
W:I said "My pretty Creole girl, my money here's no good
W:If it weren't for the alligators I'd sleep out in the wood"
W:"You're welcome here kind stranger, our house it is very plain
W:But we never turn a stranger out by the Lakes of Pontchartrain."

W:The hair upon her shoulders in jet black ringlets fell
W:To try and paint her beauty I'm sure it would be in vain
W:So handsome was my Creole girl by the Lakes of Pontchartrain.
W:
W:I asked her if she'd marry me, she'd said that could never be
W:For she had got another and he was far at sea
W:She said that she would wait for him and true she would remain
W:Till he returned for his Creole girl by the Lakes of Pontchartrain.

W:And I'll drink a health to my Creole girl by the Lakes of Pontchartrain.
