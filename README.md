# Markov Generated Sheet Music

I started this project for a Music Composition Hackathon at Spotify. I wanted to algorithmically generate music using a trained model.The event centered around a performace at the end of the night and so I wanted to create music that could be performed by a person. Generating sheet music seemed like it would be a very difficult problem but after some research, I was excited to discover a file format called [abc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation) that gives a textual representation of a score. Then all I needed was to find a large dataset of abc sheet music and I was able to generate my own songs. 

Here's a hint of what the output looks like. To see the whole song, and others, checkout the files in the my_songs folder.

This song, and Markov Song 18:32 were performed at the hackathon on a flute and thumb piano respectively by two very excellent (and talented) volunteers.
